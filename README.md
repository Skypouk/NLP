Analysing and Manipulating the sentiment of appreciations using NLP. In this project, we used a Convolutional Neural Network with filters of sizes 3 to 5 in order to complete the following goals :
- Predict the sentiment of a text.
- Manipulate the sentiment of a text, which means changing some of its words in order to change or emphasize the sentiment.
